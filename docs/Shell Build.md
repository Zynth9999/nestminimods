# Nest Mini (1st Gen) shell build

The Nest Mini is made up of three main components: the **base**, the **speaker disc**, and the fabric **diffuser**. All parts are held together using **T6 Torx screws**.

### Base

The base has a rubber pad underneath to prevent the device from sliding. To remove it, gently lift the more solid part of the base—avoid prying under the rubber itself, as this can tear it.

### Speaker Disc

The speaker disc is a single module that occupies most of the internal space. There’s nothing else inside except the speaker itself.

### Fabric Diffuser

⚠️ **Do not wash this!** Washing can dissolve the glue holding the fabric to the plastic frame, causing it to detach. Reattaching it is very difficult (ask me how i know...).
